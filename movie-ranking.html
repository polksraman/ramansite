<h3>Crimson Tide</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Denzol Wasington movie. I love his persistence in not launching the Missile.</p>
<h3>It's A Wonderfull Life</h3>
<p>I like it, because it mirrors the Bible ( help others for sure God will look after you)</p>
<h3>Fiddler on the Roof</h3>
<p>Super & Hilarious & Insightfull, Thavya was realy good.</p>
